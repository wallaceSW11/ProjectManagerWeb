# Product Overview

ProjectManagerWeb is a web-based project management tool designed to streamline local development workflows. It automates the process of managing multiple Git repositories and running development servers.

## Core Features

- **Repository Management**: Clone, configure, and manage multiple Git repositories from a central interface
- **Multi-Project Automation**: Start 3+ projects simultaneously with a few clicks instead of manually opening terminals
- **IIS Integration**: Manage IIS sites, application pools, and deployments
- **PowerShell Execution**: Execute commands via PowerShell for Windows-based development workflows
- **Folder Organization**: Organize and track project folders with custom configurations

## Target Users

Developers working on multiple projects simultaneously who need to quickly spin up development environments without manually navigating folders and running commands.

## Development Philosophy

Built in "go horse" / "vibe coding" mode - prioritizes functionality and speed over perfect architecture. Works well but can be evolved with better practices over time.
